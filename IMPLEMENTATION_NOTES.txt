SECURITY AUDIT COMPLETED - REVIEW BEFORE PRODUCTION PUSH
========================================================

Summary:
- Comprehensive security audit completed for pre-production review
- Credentials properly protected from git ✓
- OAuth scope management excellent ✓
- ONE CRITICAL ISSUE: OAuth tokens stored as plaintext in SQLite ⚠️

Critical Issue Found:
The participant_tokens table stores access_token and refresh_token as unencrypted TEXT.
This violates OWASP cryptographic storage standards and must be fixed before production.

Solution: AES-256-GCM encryption (2-3 hours to implement)
- Encrypt tokens before storing in database
- Decrypt when retrieving from database
- Keep plaintext only in memory during use
- Generate encryption key: openssl rand -hex 32
- Store key in TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY environment variable

Implementation Guide:
1. Create server/src/encryption.js (provided in docs/TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_GUIDE.md)
2. Generate TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY (see guide)
3. Modify token storage/retrieval to encrypt/decrypt (see guide)
4. Write tests (see guide)
5. Migrate existing tokens (migration script provided)
6. Test with real OAuth flow
7. Commit: "feat: encrypt OAuth tokens at rest in database"
8. Deploy to production

Documentation Created:
- docs/SECURITY_AUDIT.md - Comprehensive 200+ line audit report
- docs/TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_GUIDE.md - Step-by-step implementation guide with code
- SECURITY_SUMMARY.md - Executive summary and checklist
- SECURITY_AUDIT_COMPLETE.md - This summary for review

Next Steps:
1. Review SECURITY_SUMMARY.md (5-10 min overview)
2. Review docs/TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_GUIDE.md for implementation
3. Implement token encryption before production push
4. Run tests to verify
5. Deploy with confidence

Risk Assessment:
- Critical issue if not fixed: Database compromise = token compromise = user data at risk
- Effort to fix: Low (2-3 hours, straightforward implementation)
- Recommendation: Fix now before first production deployment
