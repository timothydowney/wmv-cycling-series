## Key Concepts

### Weekly Competition
1. Admin creates week (segment, date, time window)
2. Participants connect Strava (one-time OAuth)
3. Participants ride and sync to Strava
4. Admin triggers batch fetch
5. System finds best activity per participant
6. Leaderboard automatically updates with rankings and points

### Scoring
- **Base Points:** Number of participants you beat + 1 (for competing)
- **PR Bonus:** +1 if you set a personal record
- **Season Total:** Sum of all weekly points
- **Architecture:** Scores computed on-read from activities table (not cached), ensures deletion safety

### Authentication
- Each participant has unique Strava OAuth tokens
- Tokens auto-refresh every 6 hours
- Sessions stored in database (production) or memory (dev)

### Scale
- Designed for <100 participants
- SQLite handles thousands of activities easily
- No scaling concerns for Western Mass Velo
