# Docker build ignore file
# Excludes files from being copied to Docker images during build
# CRITICAL: Only exclude files that are truly not needed in production
# The Dockerfile builder stage will create what's needed (dist, node_modules)

# Git metadata is REQUIRED for cache invalidation during Docker builds
# Remove from this list so commits trigger proper rebuilds
# .git         <- INTENTIONALLY NOT IGNORED (used as cache buster)
