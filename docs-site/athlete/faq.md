# Athlete FAQ

Got questions? Here are the answers to the most common questions.

## Connecting & Accounts

**Q: Is it safe to connect my Strava account?**
A: Yes! We use industry-standard OAuth, the same security Strava uses when apps request your data. Your password is never shared with us—Strava handles authentication.

**Q: Can I connect with multiple Strava accounts?**
A: Not simultaneously. You can disconnect one and connect another, but only one active connection per user.

**Q: What if I'm on multiple teams?**
A: The app is per-event. Each event belongs to its own community. If there are multiple communities, each would have their own separate leaderboard.

**Q: Can someone else see my activities?**
A: Only activities completed during event windows and only to other logged-in participants. Your historical activities and data outside event windows are private.

## Riding & Events

**Q: What if I'm out of town during an event?**
A: You can still participate if Strava has the segment! Your location doesn't matter for segment times.

**Q: Can I do the segment on a stationary bike?**
A: Yes! If your stationary bike syncs to Strava, it counts.

**Q: What if I miss the time window by 2 minutes?**
A: Activities outside the time window don't count. Plan ahead so you finish before the deadline. Ask your admin if an extension is possible.

**Q: Can I do multiple activities on the same day?**
A: Yes! We automatically pick your fastest qualifying activity. Other rides on the same day are ignored.

**Q: The segment was harder than expected. Can times be adjusted?**
A: No. Strava's data is the source of truth. Ask your admin if conditions warrant a re-ride or a mulligan event.

## Leaderboards & Points

**Q: Why did my time change on the leaderboard?**
A: It shouldn't. Your recorded time is final once results are posted. If you see a change, contact your admin.

**Q: How are points calculated again?**
A: Points = Base (number beaten) + Participation (+1) + PR Bonus (+1 if applicable). See [Understanding PR Bonuses](/athlete/pr-bonuses) for details.

**Q: What if there's a tie in times?**
A: Both tied competitors get the same rank. Example: two people both get "1st place" with the same time.

**Q: Can I see historical leaderboards?**
A: Yes! Use the week selector on the homepage. All past events stay available.

**Q: How often do leaderboards update?**
A: After the admin fetches results, leaderboards update within seconds.

## Personal Records

**Q: Can I see all my PRs?**
A: Yes! Check your profile or activity history. The app also highlights when you set a PR on that week's leaderboard.

**Q: What if I rode the segment twice in one week?**
A: Only your fastest time counts toward scoring and PR calculation. The second ride is ignored.

**Q: Do PRs reset at the end of the season?**
A: No. PRs are permanent per segment. Even if the season ends, your record is your record.

**Q: What if Strava says I set a PR but the leaderboard shows I didn't?**
A: Strava and our app calculate PRs differently. Strava's is per-segment, ever. Ours is specifically for event-day attempts. They may not match if you rode it outside an event window before.

## Privacy & Data

**Q: How long do you keep my data?**
A: As long as you're connected and participating. Once you disconnect, we keep historical data for competition integrity. You can request deletion anytime—we'll remove everything except anonymized historical records within 48 hours.

**Q: Who can see my activities?**
A: Only other logged-in participants see event-day activities on leaderboards. No one sees your training rides or activities outside event windows.

**Q: Can I download my data?**
A: Not yet, but it's on the roadmap. For now, contact your admin for a data export.

**Q: Are you affiliated with Strava?**
A: No. We're a community project built using Strava's API. We're not endorsed by Strava, and Strava isn't involved in our operations.

**Q: Can I opt out of the leaderboard?**
A: Not while participating. The whole point is competition. But you can disconnect anytime.

## Troubleshooting

**Q: My activity doesn't appear on the leaderboard. Why?**
A: Check:
- Was it during the event time window?
- Does it have the right segment?
- Is it in your Strava account (public or follower-visible)?
- Did you complete the required number of reps in one activity?

If all those check out, contact your admin.

**Q: The leaderboard shows the wrong time for me.**
A: Refresh your browser. If it persists, contact your admin to re-fetch results.

**Q: I see "Connection failed" when trying to connect.**
A: Try:
1. Refresh the page
2. Check your internet connection
3. Try a different browser
4. Contact your admin if it keeps happening

**Q: My profile picture isn't showing.**
A: It takes a few seconds to sync. Refresh the page. If you still don't see it, check your Strava privacy settings.

**Q: Can I change my name on the leaderboard?**
A: Your name comes from your Strava profile. Change it there, and it updates here after you reconnect.

## General Questions

**Q: Is there a mobile app?**
A: Not yet. But the website works great on mobile! Open it in your phone's browser.

**Q: Can I create my own event?**
A: Only if you're an admin. Ask your race organizer if you want to help run events.

**Q: What if I find a bug?**
A: Report it to your admin! If it's technical, they can forward it to the developers.

**Q: Will there be more features?**
A: Yes! Check the [Roadmap](/learn/about) to see what's coming.
