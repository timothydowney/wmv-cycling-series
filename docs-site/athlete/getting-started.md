# Getting Started as an Athlete

Welcome! This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to start competing in WMV Cycling Series events.

## What You'll Need

- ✅ A Strava account (free or paid)
- ✅ A bike and the ability to ride segments
- ✅ A web browser (any modern browser works)
- ❌ No special software or apps to install

## The Quick Version (90 seconds)

1. Go to https://wmv-cycling-series-production.up.railway.app
2. Click **"Connect with Strava"**
3. Approve the permissions
4. You're done! Your Strava activities will automatically sync

## Your First Event

### Step 1: Check the Event Schedule
When an admin creates a weekly event, you'll see it on the homepage. Each event shows:
- **Segment name** (what you'll be riding)
- **Date and time window** (when to complete it)
- **Required reps** (how many times up the segment)

### Step 2: Ride the Segment
During the event window:
1. Load up the segment in Strava
2. Complete the segment the required number of times in **one activity**
3. Make sure it's a real ride (or a stationary bike sync) - no manual entries
4. Finish within the time window

**Important:** Your reps need to be in the **same activity**. Two separate rides don't combine.

### Step 3: Wait for Results
After the event window closes, an admin will fetch the results. This usually happens within an hour. Your leaderboard position will appear automatically!

## Where to Find Things

### Home Page
- **Week selector** - See upcoming events and past results
- **Quick navigation** - Jump to leaderboards or your profile

### Weekly Leaderboard
After results are posted, you'll see:
- Rank (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)
- Your time on the segment
- Points earned this week
- Whether you got a PR bonus

### Season Leaderboard
Shows cumulative points across all weeks. The highest total wins the season!

## Understanding Your Performance

**Your Time:** The total time it took to complete all required reps in your best activity that day.

**Your Rank:** Where you finished compared to others (fastest = 1st).

**Points Earned:** Based on how many people you beat, plus bonuses (see [PR Bonuses](/athlete/pr-bonuses) for details).

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I submit multiple activities?**
A: Only your fastest qualifying activity counts. If you ride the segment twice on the same day, the system automatically picks the faster one.

**Q: What if my activity doesn't show up?**
A: Make sure it:
- Was completed during the event time window
- Contains the correct segment
- Has the required number of reps (all in one activity)
- Is saved on Strava (wait a few minutes after finishing)

**Q: Can I disconnect and reconnect?**
A: Yes! You can disconnect anytime from your profile. To rejoin, just click "Connect" again.

**Q: What happens to my data?**
A: You can request deletion anytime. Your data will be permanently removed within 48 hours. See our [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/timothydowney/wmv-cycling-series/blob/main/PRIVACY_POLICY.md) for details.
