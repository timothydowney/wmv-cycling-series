# Understanding Leaderboards

Leaderboards show how everyone performed on a segment during an event. Here's how to read them.

## Weekly Leaderboard

After an event ends and results are fetched, you'll see a table showing:

| Column | What It Means |
|--------|--------------|
| **Rank** | Your position (1st = fastest) |
| **Name** | The participant's name |
| **Time** | Total time to complete all required reps |
| **Points** | Points earned this week (based on rank + bonuses) |

### Example
In an event where the segment needs **2 laps**:

```
Rank  Name    Time      Points
1     Alice   14:32     5
2     Bob     15:08     3
3     Carol   16:45     1
```

- **Alice** completed 2 laps fastest (14 min 32 sec) → Beats Bob and Carol → 2 points
- **Alice** participated → +1 point
- **Alice** set a PR → +1 bonus point
- **Total: 4 points** (plus 1 for participation = 5)

**Alice appears on the leaderboard. Dave, who didn't ride, doesn't appear.**

## Season Leaderboard

Scroll to the "Season" tab to see total points across **all weeks**. This shows:

| Column | What It Means |
|--------|--------------|
| **Rank** | Overall season ranking |
| **Name** | Participant name |
| **Total Points** | Sum of all weekly points earned |
| **Weeks Completed** | How many events they participated in |

The person with the most total points wins the season!

### Example Season
After 4 weeks:

```
Rank  Name    Total Points  Weeks Completed
1     Alice   18 points     4
2     Carol   14 points     4
3     Bob     12 points     4
4     Eve     8 points      2
```

Alice is winning with 18 points from all 4 events. Eve only rode in 2 events but still appears.

## Points Breakdown

Every week, you earn points based on:

| Source | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Beating competitors | Number of people faster than you |
| Participating | +1 (always, if you completed the event) |
| PR Bonus | +1 (if you set a personal record) |

**Maximum per week:** Depends on field size + 2 bonuses

**Example:** With 10 competitors:
- Best possible: 9 (beat everyone) + 1 (participated) + 1 (PR) = **11 points**
- Average: 5-6 points
- No show: **0 points** (doesn't appear on leaderboard)

## Personal Records (PR)

A **PR** means you completed this segment faster than you ever have before.

- If you beat your previous time on the same segment → **PR achieved!**
- Earn **+1 bonus point** this week
- Your PR time is now your new record for that segment

## Filters & Sorting

Most leaderboards let you:
- **Sort by rank** (fastest first)
- **Sort by points** (most points first)
- **Sort by name** (alphabetical)

Click column headers to change sorting. Some events let you filter by team or category.

## Ties

If two people have the **exact same time**:
- They share the same rank (both "1st", both "2nd", etc.)
- Points are calculated based on final rank
- The ranking reflects true performance

## Common Questions

**Q: Why don't I appear on the leaderboard?**
A: Your activity didn't qualify. Check that:
- You rode during the event window
- You completed the required number of reps in one activity
- Your activity is saved on Strava
- You're connected with your Strava account

**Q: How often does the leaderboard update?**
A: After an admin fetches results, leaderboards update within seconds. The admin typically does this within an hour of the event ending.

**Q: What if I rode but the leaderboard is wrong?**
A: Contact your event organizer. They can re-fetch results or manually check your data.

**Q: Can I see historical results?**
A: Yes! Use the week selector on the homepage. Past events stay on the leaderboard forever.

**Q: What about private activities?**
A: If your activities are private on Strava, we can't see them. Make them public or visible to followers for them to count.
