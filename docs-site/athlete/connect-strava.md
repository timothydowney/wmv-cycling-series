# Connect Your Strava Account

Connecting your Strava account takes about 30 seconds. Here's how.

## Why Connect?

When you connect, we can:
- ✅ See your activities during event days
- ✅ Automatically find your segment completions
- ✅ Calculate your times and ranking
- ✅ Check if you set a personal record

We **cannot**:
- ❌ Access your private activities (unless you shared them with followers)
- ❌ See your passwords or login info
- ❌ Modify your activities
- ❌ Share your data with sponsors or media

## Step-by-Step

### 1. Start the Connection
Go to [wmv-cycling-series-production.up.railway.app](https://wmv-cycling-series-production.up.railway.app) and look for the **"Connect with Strava"** button.

Click it.

### 2. Review Permissions
You'll be taken to Strava's website. A screen will show:
- **WMV Cycling Series** is requesting permission
- We're asking for: "Activity access" and "Profile information"

This is normal! We need these to see your segment data.

### 3. Authorize
Click the blue **"Authorize"** button.

### 4. You're Connected!
You'll be sent back to WMV Cycling Series. You should see:
- Your name and profile picture
- A **"Disconnect"** button (if you ever want to unplug)

**Done!** Your Strava account is now connected.

## Troubleshooting Connection

### "Connection Failed" Error
- Make sure you clicked "Authorize" on Strava
- Try refreshing the page and connecting again
- Check that you're using the correct Strava password

### I Don't See the Connect Button
- Are you on the homepage? Look in the top navigation
- Try refreshing the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
- Check that you're not already connected (you'd see your name instead)

### I'm Already Connected But Can't See My Name
- Try refreshing the page
- Clear your browser cache and try again
- Disconnect and reconnect

## After Connecting

Your account is now linked! Here's what happens next:

1. **Admin creates an event** - They'll announce a weekly segment challenge
2. **You ride the segment** - Complete it during the event window
3. **Results are fetched** - After the event, an admin collects all results
4. **You appear on the leaderboard** - Automatically!

You don't need to do anything special. Once connected, your Strava activities sync automatically during event windows.

## Want to Disconnect?

Click the **"Disconnect"** button on the homepage. This will:
- ✅ Remove your Strava connection
- ✅ Delete your future activities from the app
- ✅ You can reconnect anytime

Your historical leaderboard scores will remain (for competition integrity), but your personal data will be removed within 48 hours if requested.

## Privacy & Security

Your Strava data is:
- 🔐 **Encrypted** in transit (HTTPS)
- 🔐 **Encrypted** at rest in our database
- 🚫 **Never** shared with third parties
- 🗑️ **Deletable** on request (within 48 hours)

We follow Strava's privacy guidelines and industry best practices. See our [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/timothydowney/wmv-cycling-series/blob/main/PRIVACY_POLICY.md) for complete details.
