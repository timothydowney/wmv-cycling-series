# Understanding PR Bonuses

A **PR Bonus** is an extra point you earn when you set a **Personal Record** on a segment. Here's how it works.

## What's a Personal Record?

A **PR** (Personal Record) means your ride was **faster than your previous best time on that same segment**.

### Example
- **Last month:** You rode "Lookout Mountain" in 15:30
- **This week:** You rode "Lookout Mountain" in 15:08
- **Result:** That's a new PR! (You were 22 seconds faster)
- **Bonus:** +1 point for setting the PR

## How PR Bonuses Work

Every week:
1. **You complete the event** and do the segment your best
2. **System compares** your time to your previous best on that segment
3. **If faster:** You get **+1 PR bonus point**
4. **If slower or same:** No PR bonus (but you still earn base points for placing)

## The 1-Point-Per-Week Rule

**Important:** You only earn **1 PR bonus per week**, even if multiple things happen:

### Example
You complete 2 laps on "Lookout Mountain":
- Lap 1: 15:08 (new PR! 💪)
- Lap 2: 15:30 (also faster than your old PR, but...)

**You earn:** +1 PR bonus (not +2)

### Why One Per Week?
It keeps the scoring fair. If you rode the segment 10 times one week, you wouldn't earn 10 PR bonuses. Just one reward for "this was a strong week."

## Tracking Your PRs

Your personal records are tracked **per segment**. Each segment has its own record:

```
Segment              Your PR
Lookout Mountain     15:08
Main Street          8:45
Valley Loop          42:30
```

Every segment's PR can be beaten independently. Breaking your PR on one segment doesn't affect your record on another.

## PR Bonuses Don't Stack

**You cannot earn multiple PR bonuses in one week.** Even if you:
- Set a PR on Lap 1 of the segment
- Set another PR on Lap 2
- Set another PR on Lap 3

**You still get:** 1 PR bonus point for the week

This is by design—it keeps scoring predictable and fair.

## How It Affects Points

Your weekly points = Base Points + Participation + **PR Bonus** + Weekly Multiplier

### Example 1: You Come in First with a PR
- 10 competitors, you're fastest
- **Base:** 9 points (beat 9 people)
- **Participation:** +1 point (you showed up)
- **PR Bonus:** +1 point (faster than your previous best!)
- **Total:** 11 points

### Example 2: You Come in Last but Set a PR
- 10 competitors, you're slowest
- **Base:** 0 points (beat no one)
- **Participation:** +1 point (you showed up)
- **PR Bonus:** +1 point (still faster than before!)
- **Total:** 2 points

This is why PR bonuses are valuable—you can earn points even if you don't place high, as long as you're improving!

### Example 3: You Don't Beat Your PR
- 10 competitors, you come in 5th
- **Base:** 5 points (beat 5 people)
- **Participation:** +1 point (you showed up)
- **PR Bonus:** 0 points (you're slower than your best)
- **Total:** 6 points

## Tips for Getting PRs

1. **Ride hard:** Give it your best effort on the segment
2. **Choose good conditions:** Ride when you're rested and weather is favorable
3. **Pace yourself:** For multi-lap events, manage your effort across all reps
4. **Prepare:** Warm up before the segment to hit it at your best
5. **Check your history:** Know what your previous record is—it's motivation!

## Resets and Edge Cases

**Q: What if I delete my Strava account?**
A: Your PR history is deleted with it. If you reconnect, you start fresh.

**Q: What if an admin deletes my activity?**
A: That week's PR bonus goes away. But your segment PR record stays (it's based on history, not stored per-activity).

**Q: What if I ride the same segment twice in one week?**
A: Only your fastest attempt counts. The PR bonus applies to that fastest time.

**Q: Can I lose a PR?**
A: No. Once set, it's your record. You can't go backwards. Your PR always stays as your best.

## Why PRs Matter

PRs matter because they:
- **Reward improvement** - Even if others get faster, you earn points for getting better
- **Encourage variety** - You might set PRs on different weeks (some weeks you're strong, others not)
- **Make every week count** - Even if you finish last in points, a PR bonus keeps you in the race
- **Are personal** - Your PR is yours. Only you can set your own record
